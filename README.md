# YourFitnessFriend
This is my Advanced Higher Computing Science Project I made in S6 using VB.NET and Intergrating with MySQL

This program is a Fitness Tracker that will track the end users fitness and calculate a fitness goal and provide an action plan which includes a diet plan depending on their actual fitness goal. 
The program take in the users data and will use this to calculate there BMR and then a calorie deficit or a calorie surplus depending on the user’s goals. 
The program will also show diet plans depending on their end goal and will create an action plan for them. 
To calculate the users BMR I will be using the Harris-Benedict formula to do this. 
I will be implementing Software Design and Development and will executing my project by using Object-Oriented Programming which will carry out an array of Objects and Records which will store the data for the user’s fitness goals. 
My main features will include a login system containing a register account page and login page which will direct the user to the home page. 
The homepage will contain a menu will direct the user to a page where they can enter their data by using there username and will display a unique ID to the user to they can view their action plan which include there goal, action steps and diet plan. 
The home page will also include a help section and include advice on what the user needs assisting with regards to their health. When the user is finished they can also logout of the program if they are done.
My project integrates with a Database using MySQL for the login system. 
It will store all the user login details in the database and will also store the fitness data. 
My project will make use of a standard algorithm and I will use an insertion sort algorithm as I believe it will be the best way to organise the fitness data and then display that to the user. 
I have made sure that my insertion sort will sort through an array of records and specifically sort through the fitness goals to ensure I run into no errors.
